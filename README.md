# Autocomplete-Engine
## Overview
The GUI-Based Autocomplete System is a Python application that reduces spelling mistakes by suggesting correctly spelled words in real time. Users don’t need to type full words. The system quickly predicts and completes them allowing users to focus on content rather than typing every letter. It is powered by a Trie data structure with frequency-aware ranking ensuring fast and accurate word predictions, designed with OOP principles and features a Tkinter-based user-friendly interface, making it both efficient and easy to use.

## Technologies Used
Python – Core programming language.
