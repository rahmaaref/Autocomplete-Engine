# Autocomplete Engine

## Overview
The GUI-Based Autocomplete System is a Python application that reduces spelling mistakes by suggesting correctly spelled words in real time. Users donâ€™t need to type full words. The system quickly predicts and completes them allowing users to focus on content rather than typing every letter. It is powered by a Trie data structure with frequency-aware ranking ensuring fast and accurate word predictions, designed with OOP principles and features a Tkinter-based user-friendly interface, making it both efficient and easy to use.


## Features
- Real-time autocomplete while typing in the entry field
- Click-to-complete suggestions
- Can be customized with domain-specific dictionaries
- Interactive GUI built with Tkinter
- Trie-based word storage for efficient insertions and prefix lookups
- Frequency-aware ranking using heapq to show top suggestions
- Modular OOP design
  

## Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Tkinter (GUI)
- CSV Dataset  


## Implementation
- OOP:
  - Trie classes demonstrate encapsulation + abstraction.
  - GUI widget customization shows inheritance + polymorphism.
  - Together, they make the code modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.
- Data Structures: Trie, Dictionary, Heap
- Algorithms: Prefix Search, Top-k Ranking
